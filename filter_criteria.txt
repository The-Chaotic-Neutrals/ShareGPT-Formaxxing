for a moment
can't help but
barely above a whisper
a hint of
a mix of
a mixture of
a touch of
it's like nothing she'd ever felt before
and yet
despite herself
warring with
her wet heat
slick folds
dusky nipples
kiss-bruised lips
a bruising kiss
arousal pooling in her belly
inner walls clenching around nothing
still lodged deep inside her
tongue darts out
voice drops to a whisper
pupils blown wide
stars burst behind her eyes
propriety be damned
heart, body and soul belong to you
chestnut eyes
fiery red hair
long lashes
grasps your chin
nails raking angry red lines
she whimpers, biting her lip
with reckless abandon
wants nothing more than to
wanton
knuckles turning white
her cheeks flaming
cheeks hollowing
heady scent of
bitten lip
half-lidded eyes
she worries her bottom lip
the world narrows
lets out a moan
breathy moan
reassuring smile
she leans in
she bites her lip
she shivers
shivers run down her spine
sends shivers down
fingers tapping
voice was barely audible
just a mere whisper
she gasps
*she gasps
gasp escapes her lips
