Launch with python Formaxxing.py either in cmd/terminal or via bat file. Currently parquet format does not work properly. Needs improvements to work across the board, but can still work with little manipulation to existing datasets.

Currently supports, plaintext, JSON and JSONL. Parquet/CSV both show up in the list, but do not convert properly at the moment.
Preview window shows the first 3 entries proccessed and converted.
Debugging currently provides error message's relating to entries and file format issues.

PR's Welcome.
